{"data":[{"key":"http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/D10003FB","description":"These Standards define what students should understand and be able to do in their study of mathematics. Asking a student to understand something means asking a teacher to assess whether the student has understood it. But what does mathematical understanding look like? One hallmark of mathematical understanding is the ability to justify, in a way appropriate to the student's mathematical maturity, why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule comes from. There is a world of difference between a student who can summon a mnemonic device to expand a product such as (a + b)(x + y) and a student who can explain where the mnemonic comes from. The student who can explain the rule understands the mathematics, and may have a better chance to succeed at a less familiar task such as expanding (a + b + c)(x + y). Mathematical understanding and procedural skill are equally important, and both are assessable using mathematical tasks of sufficient richness.","level":0,"children":[{"key":"http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/S2366905","description":"Standards for Mathematical Practice","level":1,"children":[{"key":"http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/S2366906","description":"Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.","level":2,"children":[],"_children":null,"group":3},{"key":"http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/S2366907","description":"Reason abstractly and quantitatively.","level":2,"children":[],"_children":null,"group":3},{"key":"http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/S2366908","description":"Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.","level":2,"children":[],"_children":null,"group":3},{"key":"http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/S2366909","description":"Model with mathematics.","level":2,"children":[],"_children":null,"group":3},{"key":"http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/S2366910","description":"Use appropriate tools strategically.","level":2,"children":[],"_children":null,"group":3},{"key":"http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/S2366911","description":"Attend to precision.","level":2,"children":[],"_children":null,"group":3},{"key":"http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/S2366912","description":"Look for and make use of structure.","level":2,"children":[],"_children":null,"group":3},{"key":"http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/S2366913","description":"Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.","level":2,"children":[],"_children":null,"group":3}],"_children":null,"group":3},{"key":"http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/S1143409","description":"Counting and Cardinality","level":1,"children":[{"key":"http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/S114340E","description":"Know number names and the count sequence.","level":2,"children":[{"key":"http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/S1143417","description":"Count to 100 by ones and by tens.","level":3,"children":[],"_children":null,"group":3},{"key":"http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/S1143418","description":"Count forward beginning from a given number within the known sequence (instead of having to begin at 1).","level":3,"children":[],"_children":null,"group":3},{"key":"http://asn.jesandco.org/resources/S1143419","description":"Write numbers from 0 to 20.
